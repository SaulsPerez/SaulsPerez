# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Saul and I'm from Coahuila, Mexico. Ever since I discovered videos about new technologies, I became passionate about programming and decided to pursue a professional career in this field.

Throughout my studies, I've acquired skills in various areas of programming, such as web development, database management, and the use of different programming languages. In addition to my academic background, I have experience working on personal and collaborative projects, which has allowed me to develop skills in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

I'm excited to continue growing and learning in the field of programming, and I'm willing to face new challenges and opportunities.
